# 3D Tone Generator

This repository contains the source code, DXF files, and pictures to replicate a Google Cardboard, speaker/Arduino holder, and virtual world.

# Goal

This project was made for the third assignment for Physical Computing Studio. The goal was to create a augmented virtual world. We were tasked to create a virtual world that affects the outside world. A specific tone was played when the corresponding, specific box was selected by the user.

# Process

I started the process by learning how to actuate a response from the 3-D world to the outside world. I then modeled one wall of cubes using Rhinoceros. Using each modeled cube, I set each cube to certain tone that would be played using the Arduino. To further my project, I tried to create an algorithm that would make a grid of cube and assign each cube a color and tone based on the placement in the grid. Unfortunately, I did not have enough time to complete this algorithm. I then cut out the Google Cardboard and the box that held the speaker and Arduino.
